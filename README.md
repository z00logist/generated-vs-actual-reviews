# Generated VS Actual Movie Reviews in Russian

In this project, we compare movie reviews written by humans with those generated by the rugpt3 AI. We started the AI-generated reviews with the same opening lines from real reviews to see how they stack up against each other in terms of complexity.
To assess complexity, we utilized a script from the [ComplexityModel Repository](https://github.com/PlainDocument/Complexity-models). For detailed information on the complexity measurement process, please refer to feature_extractor.py within the repository.
